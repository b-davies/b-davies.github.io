## Working on a workflow

Code notebooks provide a convenient way to document and organize a data science project from beginning to end; in otherwords, they can form the basis of a *workflow*.

## Viewer Tab

Rather than render HTML directly to your browser, you can preview the rendered version in the Viewer tab.

## What about files?

When we write code that reads from files, these need to be in places where the Quarto document can find them.

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| message: FALSE
# load tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
# read in abalone data
abalone<-read_csv("data/abalone.csv")
# plot abalone rings by diameter
ggplot(abalone,aes(x=diameter,y=rings)) +
  geom_hex()
```

## Sharing your file system

The `zip` function provides a convenient way to turn your entire working directory into a .zip file

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#zip up all of my project files
zip("myProject.zip",list.files())
```

| Lab Assignment 6    | Tuesday, October 17  |
| Project Proposal    | Thursday, October 19 |

## Project proposal

::: incremental
-   What is the topic?

-   What is the background to this topic? (2-3 citations)

-   What datasets are you intending to use?

-   How would data analysis/visualization to help you understand the topic?

-   Suggest two visualizations

## Activity: Brainstorming with Quarto

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
Put the Quarto workflow to work in brainstorming ideas for your final project!

-   Create a file system for your final project

-   Start a new Quarto document and save it to your working directory

-   Use headers to outline a data analysis process from a project you'd *like* to do.

-   Begin filling out the sections with some preliminary ideas about what kinds of data you'd useand

    -   Use links to promising datasets in the text

    -   Use code chunks with comments to draft code
:::

## Next week

-   Working with messy data

-   Exploring the `tidyverse`

-   Data transformations using `dplyr`
