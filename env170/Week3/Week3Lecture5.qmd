## Warm-up activity

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   Create a project and file system for this week's lecture

-   Download the *middlesexEColi.csv* dataset from Canvas to the appropriate place in your file system and read it into R

    -   This is data from *E. coli* tests conducted on Middlesex County surface water sources between 2018 and 2022.

-   Create a histogram of the results of these tests. The horizontal (x) axis is colony forming units per 100mL sample (cfu/100mL)

-   After you've plotted the histogram, you can use the `abline` function with the argument `v=235` to draw a vertical line at 235, and color it red.

    -   The value of 235 cfu/100mL is the State of Massachusetts accepted level for *E. coli*

## Why visualize?

Visualization helps us to identify patterns and structures in data that are not evident from tables or numerical summaries.

## How to make a good visualization

::: incremental
-   Choose the right chart for the data

-   Maximize the data-to-ink ratio

-   Make deliberate design decisions
:::

## What kind of visualization?

The type of visualization that should be used depends on the kind of information being conveyed.

## Data-ink

Data-ink (per Tufte 1983[^1]) refers to ink (or pixels) that, if erased, would reduce the information being presented.

[^1]: Tufte, Edward. 1982. *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*. Graphics Press.

Ideally, the ratio between data and total ink should be close to 1.

## Activity: To erase or not to erase?

## Chartjunk

The most egregious use of non-data ink is often referred to as *chartjunk*.

![Su, Yu-Sung. 2008. \"It\'s Easy to Produce Chartjunk Using Microsoft®Excel 2007 but Hard to Make Good Graphs.\" <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2008.03.007>.](Week3Static/chartjunk1.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Being Deliberate About Design

How does this choice help someone understand the data?

::: incremental
-   Contrast

-   Clarity

-   Highlighting

-   Messaging
:::

## Accessibility

Some design choices affect some audiences more than others

-   Color palette

-   Text and symbol sizes

## A layered grammar of graphics

A framework (per Wilkinson et al. 2005; Wickham 2010) used to describe the components of a data visualization in terms of a set of layered objects

#Create plot with ggplot2
myPlot<-ggplot(iris,aes(x=Sepal.Length,y=Petal.Length)) +

## Activity: My first plot, part 2

-   Use the `as_tibble` function to convert the `faithful` dataset from dataframe to a tibble

-   Using ggplot2, plot the `faithful` dataset as a scatterplot, with waiting time as the x variable
