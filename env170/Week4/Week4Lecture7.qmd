## Warm-up activity

-   Create a file system for this week and open the script on Canvas

-   Fix the errors in the code so it works

-   Modify the colors/symbols to better express the data (remember to check your cheatsheet!)

```{r}

#Plot bill depth by species and sex
myPlot<-ggplot(data=penguins,aes(x=species,y=bill_depth_mm,color=sex))+
    geom_jitter(width=0.2) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("Orange","Green"))+
    labs(x="Species",y="Bill Depth (mm)",color="Sex")

## Data collection and data re-use

Data is usually collected with a particular goal in mind

-   Answering a research question (e.g., "What is the effect of animal cuteness on conservation priorities?")

-   Establishing baselines (e.g., employment and wage census of workers in the hospitality industry )

-   Meeting reporting requirements (e.g., EPA chemical storage and release reporting)

## Data collection and data re-use

When we re-use publicly available data, we do not have control over collection protocols, so our initial assessment will require us be critical about

-   whether data exists that can help us to answer our question

-   what the quality of that data is

-   whether the data shows patterning

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to evaluating data prior to formal modeling or hypothesis testing.

## Describing Data

-   Nominal: no meaningful distance or order.

-   Ordinal: meaningful order but not distance.

-   Interval: meaning distance but no true zero.

-   Ratio: meaningful distance with true zero.

## Nominal data

Data have no meaningful distance or order.

## Ordinal data

Data have meaningful order but no meaningful distance.

## Interval data

Data have meaningful distance but no true zero

## Ratio data

Data have meaningful distance and true zero.

## Exploring variables

Univariate: Looking at one variable/column at a time

::: incremental
-   Bar chart -- discrete `ggplot() + geom_bar()`

-   Histograms -- continuous `ggplot() + geom_histogram()`

-   Boxplot - continuous 	`ggplot() + geom_boxplot()`
:::

## Distributions

![](Week4Static/continuous distributions.png){fig-align="center"}

## Interpreting a histogram

Measures of Center

::: incremental
-   Mean: Average value of all data `mean()`

-   Median: Central value of all data `median()`
:::

## Interpreting a histogram

::: incremental
-   Range: Difference between largest and smallest values

-   Standard deviation: Distance from mean
:::

## Exploring interactions between variables

Multivariate : Looking at relationship between two or more variables

::: incremental
-   Scatter plots `ggplot() + geom_point()`

-   Bar chart `ggplot() + geom_bar()`

-   Line plots `ggplot() + geom_line()`

-   Heatmaps `ggplot() + geom_tile()`
:::

## Exploring interactions between variables

```{r}
library(modeldata)
ggplot(data=crickets,aes(x=temp,y=rate)) +
  geom_point()
```
