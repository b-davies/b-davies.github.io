## Linear modeling

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
treeDataNC<-read_csv("data/TS3_Raw_tree_data.csv") |>
  filter(City=="Charlotte, NC") |>
  filter(CommonName=="Willow oak")
```

Unlike hypothesis tests, we are often making judgement calls about how well a model fits the data.

## Linear modeling

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
ggplot(treeDataNC,aes(x=`DBH (cm)`,y=`TreeHt (m)`)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE)
```

## Testing assumptions

**Linearity**: The relationship between X and the mean of Y is linear.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
treeModel<-lm(`TreeHt (m)`~`DBH (cm)`,data=treeDataNC)
plot(treeModel,which=1)
```

**If plot is flat-ish, we can proceed...**

## Testing assumptions

**Normality**: For any fixed value of X, Y is normally distributed.

```{r}
#| echo: true 
#| message: false 
 plot(treeModel,which=2)
```

**If plot mostly adheres to diagonal line, we can proceed..**

## Testing assumptions

**Homoscedasticity**: The variance of residual is the same for any value of X.

```{r}
#| echo: true  
#| #| message: false   
plot(treeModel,which=3)
```

**If plot is mostly flat, we can proceed..**

## Posters

-   Make it readable

-   Show, don't tell

## Make it readable

-   Consistent and clean layout; context oriented in a single direction

-   Headings should clearly readable and convey the idea behind graphics or text sections

-   Graphic elements should be able to be seen from 10 feet away

## Make it readable

## Show, don't tell

-   Fewer words, bigger words

-   Limit use of text (800-1200 words max)

-   Graphics should be largely self-explantory

-   The poster is meant to come with an interpreter: you!

## Activity: Draft a poster

Find a poster template or build your own!

-   You can use your preferred platform, or there is a PowerPoint template on Canvas

If you have any draft graphics, you can also add these in the appropriate places to beginning filling out the space

Poster size should be 36 in wide by 48 inches

## Next week

-   Tuesday I will be holding final project consultations on Zoom between 10 AM and 1PM. A signup will be posted shortly.

-   If you need to discuss your project outside this time, please connect with me as soon as possible.

-   Have a great weekend and a great break!
