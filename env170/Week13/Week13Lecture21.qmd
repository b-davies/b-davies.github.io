## Some things I heard last night

::: incremental
-   Is it OK if I don't have a significant relationship?
-   Do I need to revise my project if I can't answer my question with the data?
-   **What if my results don't show anything exciting/interesting?**

-   A negative result is a result nonetheless.

-   If your assumptions/predictions didn't work out, ask why not.

-   If your results are inconclusive, ask what data might be needed.

-   How does your result compare with other studies?

## Fail productively, fail gloriously

Â 

"To fail productively, one has to be aware of the multiple contexts of that fail to find the valuable experience. To fail gloriously is to use the privileges that you have, as you are able, to make it safe for others to fail." - Shawn Graham, *Failing Gloriously*

## Reporting the results of a statistical test

When reporting the results of a statistical test, be sure to include the following information at a minimum *within the context of the hypothesis*:

-   Name of test and variable(s)

-   Test statistic(s) (letter will vary)

-   Degrees of freedom (*df*)

-   P-value (*p*)

## Reporting the results of a statistical test

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(palmerpenguins)

#create a dataset of just Adelie and Gentoo penguins, and just the species and body mass columns
genChin <- penguins %>%
        filter(species == "Chinstrap" | species== "Gentoo") %>%
        select(species, body_mass_g) %>%
        drop_na()

t.test(data = genChin, body_mass_g ~ species)
```

## Reporting the results of a statistical test

\

"I used Welch's two-sample t-test of the body masses for Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins, and rejected the null hypothesis that there is no difference in mean body mass between these two groups (*t*=-20.62, *df*=170.4, *p*\<2.2e-16)."

## Image file formats

There are two main types of image formats

-   Bitmap (also known as raster)

-   Vector

## Bitmap vs Vector

## Bitmap vs Vector

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Bitmap**

-   Sharpness depends on resolution and size

-   Consistent appearance across platforms

-   Best for complex images (photos, large numbers of elements)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Vector**

-   Sharpness is scale-independent

-   Can look differently using different programs

-   Best for simple images (line drawings, simple graphs)

|----------------|--------|------------------------|
