## Activity: A Story in Three Images

Working together in pairs, go the Canvas assignment and choose a story from a list. Your task is to convey the main idea to us in three images [without]{.underline} using images directly from that story.

Use the internet to find (tasteful, appropriate) images to tell your story. Add these to the Canvas response.

In each image, think carefully about how

-   The setup, rise, apex, resolution

-   The mood of the story
