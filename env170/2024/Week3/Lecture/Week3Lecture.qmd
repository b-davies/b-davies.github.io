## Quick review

What can we do to improve this code?

`#create a variable of 500 numbers from a standard normal distribution`{style="color: green"}

`x<-rnorm(0,1)`

`#create another variable from the same data but squared`{style="color: green"}

`x^2`

`#make it into a scatter plot`{style="color: green"}

`scatterplot(x,y)`

#create a variable of 500 numbers from a standard normal distribution
x<-rnorm(500,0,1)

#create another variable from the same data but squared
y<-x^2

## Sensor of the day

Instruments may include:

-   Thermometer: Temperature

-   Rain gauge: Precipitation

-   Barometer: Atmospheric pressure

-   Anemometer: Wind speed

-   Wind vane: Wind direction

-   Pyranometer: Solar radiation

## Finding data

The main assignment for this course will involve conducting your own data analysis and visualization using data of your choice.

That data is out there, somewhere, waiting for you...

## What kind of data?

Data are most useful when they are in *machine-readable* formats

-   .csv, .tsv, .txt, .ncdf, .jpg, .tiff, .xml, .kml, .shp

## What kind of data?

Data are most useful when they are in *non-proprietary*, *widely-used* formats

## Activity: Take the Weather With You

Visit the Climate Data Online portal: <https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/>

-   Choose **Browse Datasets**, expand **Daily Summaries**, then click **Search Tool**

-   Search for station data in any part of the world and add it to your cart

-   Select the option to download a **Custom GHCN-Daily CSV** and choose the data types you want to include

-   Download it to your computer, move it to the appropriate spot in your file system, then read it into R using `read_csv`

## Reliable sources

Primary data often come from government clearinghouses (.gov), research institutions (.edu), or from non-governmental organizations (.org)

[Example 1](http://data.uis.unesco.org/)

Published alongside research publications (Figshare, Zenodo, etc.)

[Example 2](https://figshare.com/categories/Environmental_sciences/26863?categories=26932)

Data that you or someone you know collects

[Example 3](https://b-davies.github.io/files/SPRING_CAVE_LITHICS.csv)

## Metadata

Metadata are data about data.

## Metadata

Metadata are data about data.

\
These are tell us things like how the data were collected, by whom, when, how it is structured, etc.

## Examples of metadata

\
Example 1: [CDO Daily Summaries](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/locations/FIPS:AY/detail#stationlist)\

Example 2: [USGS Earthquake Archives](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/)

## Metadata make data FAIR

-   **Findable:** Metadata make it much easier to find relevant data.

-   **Accessible:** Metadata indicate how data can be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorization.

-   **Interoperable :**Â Assigning metadata enables a data set to be integrated with other data.

-   **Re-usable:** Well-described data can be used by others!

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
On Canvas, there is a page listing data sources you might use in this course.

Choose 2 sources of interest and download some data, ideally stored in .csv or similar, but if it's something else we can try and figure it out

Store the data somewhere that makes sense for your file system so you can come back to it.

Be prepared to answer the following questions:

-   What was the data?

-   How easy was it to figure out the interface? Did anything trip you up?

-   Were there any metadata that accompanied the data?

## Messy data

Data often comes with issues caused by data entry error, poor data collection decisions, or use of outmoded or proprietary formats.
