## Quarto

Quarto is a data science documentation and publishing system that comes built-in to RStudio.

## Isn't code reproducible by default?

Code will do precisely what we want, but it will not necessarily understood by others.

## Literate programming

An approach to writing software that centers the human user (and re-user) by combining natural language explanations with code.

## Code notebooks

A code notebook is software tool for literate programming.

## Working on a workflow

Code notebooks provide a convenient way to document and organize a data science project from beginning to end; in otherwords, they can form the basis of a *workflow*.

## What about files?

When we write code that reads from files, these need to be in places where the Quarto document can find them.

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| message: FALSE
# load tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
# read in abalone data
abalone<-read_csv("data/abalone.csv")
# plot abalone rings by diameter
ggplot(abalone,aes(x=diameter,y=rings)) +
  geom_hex()
```

## Sharing your file system

The `zip` function provides a convenient way to turn your entire working directory into a .zip file

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#zip up all of my project files
zip("myProject.zip",list.files())
```

| Assignment          | Due Date             |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Coding Assignment 1 | Wednesday, October 9 |
| Lab Assignment 6    | Monday, October 14   |
| Project Proposal    | Friday, October 18   |
| Lab Assignment 7    | Monday, October 21   |

## Project proposal

::: incremental
-   What is the topic?

-   What is the background to this topic? (2-3 citations)

-   What datasets are you intending to use?

-   How would data analysis/visualization to help you understand the topic?

-   Suggest two visualizations

## Activity: Brainstorming with Quarto

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
Put the Quarto workflow to work in brainstorming ideas for your final project!

-   Create a file system for your final project

-   Start a new Quarto document and save it to your working directory

-   Use headers to outline a data analysis process from a project you'd *like* to do.

-   Begin filling out the sections with some preliminary ideas about what kinds of data you'd useand

    -   Use links to promising datasets in the text

    -   Use code chunks with comments to draft code
:::

## Next week

-   Working with messy data

-   Exploring the `tidyverse`

-   Data transformations using `dplyr`
