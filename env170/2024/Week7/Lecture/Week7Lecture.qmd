## Warm-Up Activity

```{r}
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
library(modeldata)

```

Convert the `airquality` dataset (from the **datasets** package) to a tibble and create a scatterplot with a smooth line showing the relationship between temperature and ozone levels *for each month* in the dataset. You may find the following functions helpful in this process:

-   `facet_wrap` to make a faceted plot

-   `vars` to define which variable to use for facets

-   `drop_na` to remove rows with NA values in certain columns

-   `as.character` to coerce numbers or other data types to character values

## First look

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
aq<-as_tibble(airquality)
ggplot(drop_na(aq,Temp,Ozone),aes(x=Temp,y=Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(as.character(Month)))
```

## Labeling facets

Facets are not treated as part of the aesthetic mapping in `aes`. One way to relabel these is to use `fct_recode` inside the `vars` function to change the factor names.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| output: false
#| class-output: OutputCode
aq<-as_tibble(airquality)
ggplot(drop_na(aq,Temp,Ozone),aes(x=Temp,y=Ozone)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(fct_recode(as.character(Month),May="5",June="6",July="7",August="8",September="9")))
```

## Labeling facets

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
aq<-as_tibble(airquality)
ggplot(drop_na(aq,Temp,Ozone),aes(x=Temp,y=Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(fct_recode(as.character(Month),May="5",June="6",July="7",August="8",September="9")))
```

## Editing facet axis scales

For the same reason, we can't access facet axis scales using any `scales_*` functions. We can modify these in the `facet_wrap` function with the **scales** argument.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| output: false
#| class-output: OutputCode
aq<-as_tibble(airquality)
ggplot(drop_na(aq,Temp,Ozone),aes(x=Temp,y=Ozone)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(fct_recode(as.character(Month),May="5",June="6",July="7",August="8",September="9")),scales="free")
```

## Editing facet axis scales

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| output: true

aq<-as_tibble(airquality)
ggplot(drop_na(aq,Temp,Ozone),aes(x=Temp,y=Ozone)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(fct_recode(as.character(Month),May="5",June="6",July="7",August="8",September="9")),scales="free")
```

## Editing facet axis scales

We can change a single scale with the argument *"free_x"* or *"free_y"*.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
aq<-as_tibble(airquality)
ggplot(drop_na(aq,Temp,Ozone),aes(x=Temp,y=Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(fct_recode(as.character(Month),May="5",June="6",July="7",August="8",September="9")),scales="free_x")
```

  facet_wrap(vars(fct_recode(as.character(Month),May="5",June="6",July="7",August="8",September="9")),scales="free_x")
```

## Activity: Let's get ethical

Take a moment and go over one or more of your datasets from your project to address the following questions:

-   What do you know about where your data comes from? Where would you find out?

-   What are some potential sources of bias in your data?

-   Are there any ways your use of this data cause harm or propagate biases?

With one of your neighbors, discuss your project in terms of ethical principles of non-maleficence, beneficence, autonomy, and justice.

## Making choices

"When a designer chooses a graphic form to represent data just because she likes it, while ignoring evidence that may lead her to choose a more appropriate one, her act is morally wrong. It’s not wrong just because she’s not been virtuous or because there is a deontological rule against inappropriate charts, but because her act will likely have negative consequences, such as confusion, obfuscation and misunderstanding." -Alberto Cairo, "Ethical Infographics"
