## Introducing R scripts

An R script is a text document that contains lines of R code that can be delivered individually or collectively to the command line.

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| output: FALSE

varA<-c(1:500)
varB<-runif(500,1,100)

data<-data.frame(varA,varB)

plot(data$varA,data$varB,type="l",col="orchid2")
```

## Introducing R scripts

An R script is a text document that contains lines of R code that can be delivered individually or collectively to the command line.

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE

varA<-c(1:500)
varB<-runif(500,1,100)

data<-data.frame(varA,varB)

plot(data$varA,data$varB,type="l",col="orchid2")
```

## Introducing R scripts

Scripts are text files, so they can be written, saved, and shared relatively easily.

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| output: FALSE

varA<-c(1:500)
varB<-runif(500,1,100)

data<-data.frame(varA,varB)

plot(data$varA,data$varB,type="l",col="orchid2")
```

## Activity

Open RStudio, go to the **File** menu, and create a new script. In that script, add some code:

-   Create a variable called **myName** and assign your name as a character string

-   Create a second variable called **introduceMe** and assign the character string "Hi, my name is". Be sure to include a space at the end of the character string.

-   Use these two variables as arguments in the `paste` function.

Highlight all of the code in the script and click **Run**.

## Comments

Comments are text preceded by a comment character. For R, the comment character is `#`. When R receives this at the command line, it knows not to run it.

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| output: FALSE

#here's where we make some data
varA<-c(1:500)
varB<-runif(500,1,100)

#here's where we put it together in a dataframe
data<-data.frame(varA,varB)


#here's where we plot that data
plot(data$varA,data$varB,type="l",col="orchid2")
```

## Comments

Comments are useful for documenting what a piece of code does, both for you and for other users. They can also be helpful for temporarily taking out a piece of code from a script without having to delete it.

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| output: FALSE

#here's where we make some data
varA<-c(1:500)
#varB<-runif(500,1,100)
varB<-rnorm(500,0,1)  #Trying out a normal distribution here

#here's where we put it together in a dataframe
data<-data.frame(varA,varB)


#here's where we plot that data
plot(data$varA,data$varB,type="l",col="orchid2")
```

## Getting help

My recommended approach to problems you might encounter is

1.  try and change a few things, and if that doesn't work

2.  check the **Help** documentation, and if the answer isn't there

3.  search for a solution on the web, and if that fails

4.  ask someone who can help you

## Accessing help documentation

Help documents describe what functions do, what arguments they take, and what kind of objects they will return.

You can search help using the **Help** tab in the Outputs pane.

## Accessing help documentation

You can also quickly look up a function's help document by typing it into the command line preceded by a question mark (`?`). For example:

`?hist`

## Reading the help documentation

## Reading the help documentation

Help documents include:

-   **Description** What does the function do

-   **Usage** How do you call it in R?

-   **Arguments** What arguments does it take and what objects should be used?

-   **Details** Specifics about what different arguments do

-   **Value**

-   **Examples** Code showing how the code is used

## Activity

Try looking at the entry for some of the functions we've used so far. Examples include:

-   `rep`

-   `paste`

-   `scan`

-   `rnorm`

See if you can use help to find the function for the **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**.
