1) Add these global variables:

average
sd


2) Add this turtle-owned variable:

trait


3) Add sliders to the Interface for the following variables:

n-turtles 
num-bottlenecks
turtles-removed-percent

4) Add a setup procedure that
-clears the model
-sets the variable average to 0
-sets the sd variable to 1
-creates n-turtles turtles
-gives those turtles a trait drawn from a random normal distribution (using average and sd)
-resets time

5) Add a go procedure that
-asks a percentage of turtles to be removed (die)
-recalculates the average variable as the mean trait of the remaining turtles
-recalculates the standard-deviation variable as the mean trait of the remaining turtles
-creates enough new turtles to bring the population back to n-turtles
-gives those turtles a trait drawn from a random normal distribution (using the new average and sd)
-advances time
-stops the model if the number of bottlenecks equals num-bottlenecks

6) Make some setup and go buttons

7) Make a monitor that shows the mean trait of the turtles

8) Make a histogram of the turtle trait values, with x-axis limits at -3 and 3.
