I will be starting a new project this year! 

This is a three-year postdoctoral research position funded by an [NSF grant](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1826666) under the 'Dynamics of Coupled Natural Human Systems' program, entitled 'Exploring the history of coupled climatic and human influences on ecosystem changes during the last one million years'. The project is based in the Western Cape region of South Africa, where we will combine climate and ecological records with a one million-year history of human activity to better understand how coupled systems develop in the long-term.

This project will be based at the University of Utah, where I will be working with [J. Tyler Faith](https://faculty.utah.edu/u6013388-Tyler_Faith/research/index.hml) and [Mitchell Power](https://faculty.utah.edu/u0633150-MITCHELL_J._POWER/research/index.hml) in the Anthropology and Geography departments, respectively. We will also be collaborating with a team of researchers from North America, Europe, and South Africa, bringing together decades of research in the region. My role will be to develop models of human and natural systems that can be used to both clarify how patterning in long-term records is produced and how linkages between these components emerge.

This is exciting but also bittersweet news because it means I will be leaving my post as a teaching fellow at the University of Auckland, and, even more seriously, moving away from my adopted country of Aotearoa New Zealand. While I will miss all of my colleagues, I look forward to continuing my work with them from abroad, and returning to visit friends and whanau in the future.
