My colleague [Iza Romanowska](https://www.bsc.es/romanowska-iza) and I have been interested in how simulation and agent-based modeling fits within the wider sphere of archaeology. Simulation has been around for a long time in archaeology, but with changes to computing and perspectives on has become more widely used in recent years. What does this mean about the people who are using these methods? In particular, we've been wondering about how ABM operates as a computationally-driven methodology: is it geared toward younger academics? What about gender? What kinds of problems is ABM being used to address? This week we put together [a survey](https://goo.gl/forms/UIuCa6SHdPkTRKYQ2) to investigate. We're hoping to put the results together as a short paper early next year. Stay tuned!
