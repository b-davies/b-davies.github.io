OK, not so much a new paper, but a paper I wrote awhile ago (and released as a preprint [here](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tyjc9)) is now in print! The paper, entitled 'Weaving the common threads of simulation and formation studies in archaeology' looks at some ways that simulation methods are compatible with a formation-based perspective on the archaeological record. In particular, it focuses on the theoretical motivations for Schifferian/Binfordian-style middle-rangey formation-type studies, and how simulation has been used to solve similar kinds of inferential issues. The paper then draws on [my dissertation study in western New South Wales, Australia](http://librarysearch.auckland.ac.nz/UOA2_A:Combined_Local:uoa_alma21195924600002091) to demonstrate how archaeological simulations taking a formation-based perspective can be used to both explore historical processes and develop tests between competing theories. Drawing on contemporary ideas about modeling in historical sciences, the paper argues that simple, generative models that are grounded in the formational logic of the record can be valuable 'tools to think with'.

There are a number of other great papers in the CAA 2016 proceedings, entitled *Oceans of Data* You can find it available for purchase or download at [Archaeopress.](http://archaeopress.com/ArchaeopressShop/Public/displayProductDetail.asp?id={2724F16C-FAC1-4987-8D1E-E85D9F94ACAD}).
