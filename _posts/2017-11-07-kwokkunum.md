summary:    Laser scanning shell mounds at Kwokkunum

Spent some time in Anathagayth contry in western Cape York recently surveying shell mounds in an area known as Kwokkunum. Kwokkunum is just south of the Embley River near the mining settlement of Weipa. The area is a tropical and estuarine, with mangrove forests bordering the river.Shell mounds are a common feature in the coastal and riverside areas in northern Australia, usually made from mostly Anadara shells. Mounds range in sizes, some reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Some of the mounds in the region have been shown to be at around 5000 years old. 

A large part of the work involves 3D laser scanning, which is used to build 3D models and characterise the geometry of the mounds. We used a [Faro Focus X330](https://www.faro.com/en-gb/news/the-new-faro-laser-scanner-focus3d-x-330-the-perfect-instrument-for-3d-documentation-and-land-surveying-2/) terrestrial laser scanner for this. Scans were registered and a point cloud was generated using [Faro Scene 6](https://www.faro.com/products/product-design/faro-scene). Point clouds were decimated and processed using [CloudCompare](http://www.danielgm.net/cc), and then loaded into [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com) for visualisation.

A major issue with scanning in this area is vegetation. Many of the mounds are found in areas with mangrove or ironwood forest, making it difficult to obtain an unimpeded scan. We focused on a group of six shell mounds in an open and recently burned area. The mounds themselves had a number of trees growing on them, making it difficult to get coverage of the tops of the shell mounds. A set of 52 scans were taken at points within the mound complex, an area about 90,000 m<sup>2</sup>, with the aim of producing overlapping coverage in scans. Scans were then stitched together manually to produce a point-cloud model of the shell mounds.

This project was aimed at establishing the feasibility and requirements for a larger laser scanning project in the future. The laser scans can be used to compare the shape and volume of shell mounds between different areas, evaluate their state of preservation, and ultimately be incorporated into three-dimensional reconstructions for use in heritage visualizations.
