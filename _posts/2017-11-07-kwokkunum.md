Spent some time recently surveying shell mounds in western Cape York in an area known as Kwokkunum. Kwokkunum is just south of the Embley River near the mining settlement of Weipa. The area is a tropical and estuarine, with mangrove forests bordering the river.

Shell mounds are a common feature in the coastal and riverside areas in northern Australia, usually made from mostly Anadara shells. Mounds range in sizes, some reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Some of the mounds in the region have been shown to be at around 5000 years old. 

A large part of the work involves 3D laser scanning, which is used to build 3D models and characterise the geometry of the mounds. We used a [Faro Focus X330](https://www.faro.com/en-gb/news/the-new-faro-laser-scanner-focus3d-x-330-the-perfect-instrument-for-3d-documentation-and-land-surveying-2/) terrestrial laser scanner for this. Scans were registered and a point cloud was generated using [Faro Scene 6](https://www.faro.com/products/product-design/faro-scene). Point clouds were decimated and processed using [CloudCompare](http://www.danielgm.net/cc), and then loaded into [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com) for visualisation.
