Earlier in the year  I was asked to be a co-author on a paper titled ["Open Science in Archaeology"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320068431_OPEN_SCIENCE_IN_ARCHAEOLOGY) as a member of the Society for American Archaeology Open Science Interest Group (OSIG). The paper was primarily authored by Ben Marwick, with contributions from 48 others. While I'll admit my contributions to the paper were minimal among a group of 49 academics, I am in firm agreement with the principles laid out within. In that spirit, I have been working to improve the accessibility of my research and methods. This week, I added one of my models, [HMODEL](https://www.openabm.org/model/5906/version/1/view), to [OpenABM](https://www.openabm.org/): a forum that is part of the Network for Computational Modeling for SocioEcological Science (CoMSeS). The original publication included the code and documentation as electronic supplements, but this is behind a paywall and therefore less accessible to the wider ABM community. I also began hosting preprints from my publications at SocArcXiv; you can find my stuff [here](osf.io/tvnzp).
