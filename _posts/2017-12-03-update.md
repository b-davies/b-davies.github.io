While I was writing my dissertation I got interested in the idea of [pattern-oriented modeling](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/310/5750/987.full). We can make any number of models to explain the same phenomenon (the problem of equifinality), but explaining mutiple epiphenomena using the same model is harder. So ideally if we have two or more models that can explain a single pattern equally well (more or less), we should then use the mechanics of these same models to try and explain some other patterns in order to discern between them. 

I adapted this approach in [a study](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0959683615609754) of the effects of erosion and deposition on the temporal distribution of surface archaeological features in arid Australia. Surface hearths from the region display both an increase in frequency through time, and periodic gaps in the chronology. These patterns have been interpreted as resulting from different population or behavioral dynamics (population growth, change in land use intensity, abandonment, etc) and/or time-dependent taphonomic decay.

In the agent-based model I used, agents moved about the landscape randomly, making datable heat-retainer hearths that sit on the surface. At intervals between 10 and 200 years, these hearths were subject to localised sedimentary "events" that had one of two effects: deposition or erosion. If deposition occurs, hearths on the surface become buried beneath a layer of sediment and are no longer visible in the surface context. If erosion occurs, surface hearths lost their charcoal and could not be dated using the radiocarbon method, and subsurface hearths became exposed again. The simulation was run in fully depositional conditions, fully erosional conditions, and mixed conditions in between. The model also included a parameter where a percentage of the landscape remained stable during a sedimentary event. Simulations were run at a yearly time step over a period of 2000 years. 

That study showed that in mixed erosional/depositional environments, the chronometric data obtained from hearths showed both an increase in frequency toward the present and pronounced gaps in the chronology, even in the absence of any change in population or hearth-building activities. This provided a geomorphological explanation for this pattern that was contrary to the demographic/behavioral explanations already on offer. These two explantory models have different mechanics for explaining the patterning in hearth radiocarbon dates. To explore this issue further, I used an additional pattern that would be sensitive to these mechanisms: luminescence dates on hearth stones, which are not as prone to erosion as charcoal. I predicted from the simulation that if erosion were the culprit, then the gaps should not be as pronounced in the hearth stone dates; but if the cause was changes in hearth-building activities through time, then gaps should be present in both. The result was strongly in favor of the geomorphic model. 

Grimm and Railsback ([2012](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/367/1586/298)) bring up the idea that patterns used to discern between models can take on lots of different forms, and that those used in POM do not necessarily have to be "strong" statistical patterns; "weak" patterns like shape or categorical associations can also work toward differentiating between generating mechanisms. Indeed, a few "weaker" patterns together might provide better predictions than a single "strong" predictor.

In addition to chronometric information, the condition of surface hearths was also recorded using a scheme developed by Fanning et al. ([2009](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/heat-retainer-hearth-identification-as-a-component-of-archaeologi)). Six categories are buried, partially exposed, intact, disturbed, scattered, and remanant. In the simulation, though, hearths are in one of three states: buried, on the surface but intact, or on the surface and affected by erosion. Therefore, for this experiment I combined the categories of surface hearths into three preservation categories: "buried/partially intact" for hearths immediately beneath the surface, "intact/disturbed" for hearths on the surface but unaffacted by erosion, and "scattered/remnant" for hearths that were on the surface and affected by erosion.

The figure below shows results from runs with no surface stability, with erosion intervals of 50 (blue), 100 (purple), and 200 (red) years. Running the simulation under the same configurations as the original HMODEL simulation produced some interesting outcomes. For the most part, hearths in the "intact/disturbed" category were, in most cases, the youngest on average. This makes intuitive sense, as those which are in sediments that are actively eroding are likely to be somewhat older than those which are situated immediately atop them but have not yet been affected by erosion. Those that have eroded away are also older on average, which again makes sense because the erosion process has operated through time, and those which have been out on the surface longer are more likely to have been affected. Under more erosion conditions (0.9), the "scattered/remnant" hearths become noticeably older on average; this is because the process that exposes and erodes them has overwhelmed the processes that are burying and protecting them over time. Another interesting pattern is that, under highly depositional conditions (0.1), longer time intervals produces an inversion of the pattern: the oldest hearths are those which are actively sitting on the surface . This is because many young hearths are buried, and many of those that have been exposed and eroded are also likely to be deeply buried, and therefore not part of the sample of datable subsurface features.

Based on the above, the average ages for these categories for hearths at Rutherfords Creek is most consistent with the mixed depositional environment. The ages of hearths in the more depositional context are too recent by comparison, while the "scattered/remnant" hearths under more erosional conditions are too old by comparison. This is consistent with the findings in the original HMODEL study. While this doesn't confirm that the processes operating at Rutherfords Creek , it strengthens the interpretation that the distribution of hearth ages likely reflects a fairly consistent occupation intensity over the past 2000 years, with surface hearths subject to periodic, widespread relocations of sediment.

While the simulation models this process as occurring randomly across space, the nature of fluvial geomorphology means that this is unlikely to be the case. Fanning ([1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X99000148)) suggests a model where loose sediment suspended in sheetwash moves from slopes toward stream channels, eventually becoming deposited as these flows lose energy. These redpositions eventually result in channels becoming choked out, spreading erosion over lower reaches of the stream valleys. This would be expected to produce differences in the degrees of hearth visibility and preservation along the length of the stream channel. To examine this, I got the percentages of hearths in different conditions in rolling 1000m windows (overlapping at 500 metres) along a west-east axis (roughly the direction of Rutherfords Creek stream flow). Disturbed and intact hearths are pretty consistent across and don't show a statistical relationship. Partially exposed hearth, however, are found in much higher frequencies in upstream areas, while buried and particularly scattered are found with greater frequencies down toward the lake.

There are a number of potential ways this could be interpreted. Hearths that are in the "partially exposed" category are those which are actively eroding out of their sedimentary context, and their greater presence on the slopes may suggest that the current round of erosional processes is currently working through a layer of loosened sediment on the slopes. According to the model, this would have variable effects on the valley floor in terms of redepositing sediment in some places (burying hearths) and acceleratinng erosion in others (scattering them). Alternatively, hearths on the floor could be strictly in a state of intensified erosion, which both exposes the tops of hearths below the surface (showing as "buried") and scattering those that are already visible. These two different processes would have implications for the relative ages of hearths in these states. This is yet another pattern that could be investigated using a model-based approach.
