This week I am in Albuquerque for the 2019 SAA meeting. I am going to be talking about something I have worked on for a long time but mostly as a passion project: modeling ancient seafaring in the Pacific. 

The settlement of the Pacific, and particularly East Polynesia, ranks among the most substantial feats of maritime expansion in history. Beginning about 3600 years ago but occurring primarily during a few windows of 200-300 years, the region was settled by Austronesian-speaking peoples from southeast Asia. By 1200 AD, this expansion was nearly complete. However, attention on settlement sometimes overshadows even more remarkable evidence for continued interaction. This includes long distance exchange, demonstrated through distribution of stone carried on voyages that in some cases exceeding 2000 kms. The maintenance of these exchange networks persists until the century preceding European contact, eventually contracting to primarily local interactions.

Both settlement and interaction in the past depended on the knowledge of ancient seafarers, their technology, and the conditions they encountered. Anderson (2015) outlines two established positions on Pacific voyaging that differ principally in how they conceptualize of vessel seafaring capacity, but also in the kinds of data they use and how they use it. The first he describes as a 'traditionalist' view, which is based around the idea that vessels were capable of windward travel (by way of tacking), and this was used as part of a safe strategy for exploring oceanic spaces by enabling rapid return voyages. This notion is supported by observations of vessels in the central Pacific at the time of European contact that carried lateen sails. It's efficacy has been explored in numerous experimental efforts.

The alternative view presented by Anderson is the 'historicist' view. This argues that vessels observed at the margins of Polynesia used sprit sails that were not capable of sailing against the wind,  and these are remnants of a sail form that preceded a protohistoric introduction of the lateen elsewhere in the Pacific. Palaeoclimate reconstructions have supported the existence of accommodating windflows (Goodwin et al 2014).

There are many unknowns, not least due to the limited amount of direct material evidence for seafaring technology, opening the way for numerous modeling efforts. Starting with Levinson, Ward, and Webb (1973), Pacific seafaring has been studied using computer simulations in a number of different ways and related to many questions, from the benefits of upwind sailing (Irwin et al. 1990) to drifting sweet potatoes from the South American coast (Montenegro et al 2008). The use of simulation to study seafaring, particularly spatially explicit simulation, is a prime example of the eclecticism in geocomputation recently advocated by Verhagen (2018) for addressing the constantly changing nature of archaeological interpretation. 

The approach I am taking aims to ground the seascape in the perspective of a goal-directed individual who is traveling in a given direction using the changing flow of winds around them. I try to build simulations with the aim of exploring and comparing different explanatory models within a common framework. Here, I wanted to look at how much a wide range of voyages, undertaken at different times, might depend on windward sailing capacity. 

Different vessels will have different performance capacities. But in many cases, our knowledge of ancient watercraft is extremely limited, and locking models into a particular response profile may limit the applicability of models, particularly when trying to compare cases.

In an idealized world, it is ‘easiest’, as in the least work rather than optimising speed or performance, to sail in the same direction as the wind. Many have suggested that even with the capacity to sail to windward, ancient Pacific seafarers may have used a strategies that exploited seasonal or ENSO-driven shifts in wind direction to maximize opportunities to sail with the wind. So if we wanted to score ease very basically, we could say that sailing with the wind is easiest (a score of 1), and sailing against the wind, or 180 degrees off the wind, would be hardest (a score of 0). So in such a scenario, imagine that the difference between the wind direction and our desired direction were 10 degrees, our score of ease toward reaching our goal would 1 – (10/180), or 0.944.

However, as mentioned earlier, most conceptualizations imagine limits on the ability to sail off-wind. This would mean that only part of the range between with the wind and against it would give positive scores, while attempting to sail outside this limit would give a negative score. For example, imagine an extremely limited vessel that could only sail within 5 degrees of the wind direction. This would mean that only travel directions between with the wind and five degrees off it would contribute towards a positive score, while everything else would give a negative score.

If we expanded this capability, in this case let’s say to 45 degrees or 135 degrees off wind, then the area of positive scoring increases. Simulating the process this way, we can explore vessels that can only travel with the wind, to vessels that can travel against the wind, and all points in between. 

So at this basic level we need two pieces of information: where the vessel is trying to go, and what kinds of conditions they might encounter. To do this, I used two data sources. The first is a database of islands collated by Nunn and colleagues. This database contains a range of useful information, but for my purposes it gives island names, latitudes, and longitudes.

To model wind conditions likely to affect seafaring, I used the NCEP/NCAR Global Climate dataset, which includes 71+ years of daily wind direction and speed at a 2.5 degree resolution. This dataset includes 17 years featuring El Nino conditions, 17 featuring La Nina.
The wind data that underlies the model comes as gridded readings, one for each day. On top of this we have islands that we are interested in learning about. In order to score a path, we can extract the wind values that occur along a transect between the islands.
A rhumbline between two islands would be the most straightforward path, but it is entirely possible that a voyage would not necessarily travel along a straightline. Indeed, south to north return voyages of the Hokulea often shoots east of the Hawaiian Islands, using a dogleg track that takes advantage of the prevailing trades. To assess this, a series of transects are explored, calculating the rhumbline path as well as dogleg paths out to 90 degree angles between two islands.

The objective of this explore then, is to explore the space of the winds between the two points through time (hence WINDSPACE) and determine whether some vessels find some paths easier, and when. Given the architecture used here, WINDSPACE provides an efficient way to characterize , and can be used explore accessibility to wind-driven vessels at any location on the globe. 

For a case study I draw on research from the Cook Islands, a collection of 15 islands and atolls in the central Pacific Ocean. On one of these, Aitutaki, archaeological excavations have produced assemblages of stone artifacts that can be traced to locations around the Pacific, including quarries on the island of Tutuila in the Samoa group, 1200 kms to the west (Allen and Johnson 1996). However, there are a handful of islands in between which might conceivably function as waypoints: Ofu-Olosega, Ta’u, and Rose Atoll in the Samoan Group; Pukapuka, Suwarrow, and Nassau in the Northern Cooks; Palmerston Atoll at the extreme western end of the Southern Cooks, and isolated Niue. This test case is somewhat ideal to start with since there are already existing studies with which to compare outcomes.

The questions to be addressed in my talk, then, are how easy is to get from Tutuila to Aitutaki directly, or by way of one of these other islands, and whether this changes at different times?
