# Adding the `sf` package

First, we'll include the `sf` package that we'll use for working with vector data.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
require(sf)
```

Remember that this package is built as an update of the `sp` package. This uses the *Simple Features* object format, where spatial data are stored as dataframes with a special "geometry" column. This makes them more flexible for use by other packages. You can read more about Simple Features [here](http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/index.php/Simple_Features), and about the history of spatial data handling in R [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10109-020-00336-0).
