# Bring it all together!

Try to write code to do the following on your own:

* Load the biomes shapefile and radiocarbon data 
* Subset both of these to the Fynbos Biome
* Make a histogram using the dates in the fynbos subset of the radiocarbon data using the `hist` function
* Create another subset of the fynbos radiocarbon data that includes Pleistocene dates only (dates older than 11700 BP)
* Plot the following:
  + The fynbos biome in the color of your choosing (not red or black) with axes
  + The fynbos radiocarbon dates as small, black circles (you can change the size of the points using the `cex` argument)
  + Pleistocene fynbos radiocarbon dates as larger, red filled circles (you can change the symbols using the `pch` argument)
