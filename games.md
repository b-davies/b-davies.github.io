### The Last Straw
[Link](http://www.thelaststraw.ca/)

This upper division undergraduate course was aimed at exploring the transformative role of digital technology in archaeology and cultural heritage. In lectures, students were encouraged to discuss the fundamentals of different approaches within the context of the broader goals of archaeology and heritage management. Topics included: spatial data, complex systems and simulation, virtual reality, and the preservation of digital objects, among others. Experts in laser scanning, 3D modeling and archaeogaming were invited and provided interactive demonstrations. In labs, students were introduced to a range of techniques including data manipulation and visualization in R, social network analysis, augmented reality using mobile devices, and reconstructing historical landscapes in game engines. By the end of the course students were able to thoughtfully assess applications of different methods and approaches to digital archaeology and heritage, obtain and organize open-source data, and utilize data across multiple digital platforms.
