## Serious Games examples

### The Last Straw
[Link](http://www.thelaststraw.ca/)
The Last Straw! is a fun and exciting teaching tool on the social determinants of health. The game has three objectives:

*to promote discussion about the social determinants of health;
*to help players build empathy with marginalized people and gain an awareness of players' own social location;
*to encourage learning in a fun and supportive environment.

In keeping with current research on the social determinants of health, socioeconomic status is a primary determinant of health in this game, as are race, gender, sexual orientation and other factors.Feedback consistently demonstrates that players gain a better understanding of the social determinants of health and the interplay between forces at individual and community levels.  Both players and facilitators ("Game Masters") report having a great time playing the game.

We have also developed a training manual and video to help Game Masters get the most out of the game.
