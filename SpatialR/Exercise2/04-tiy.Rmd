# Bring it all together!

Try to write code to do the following on your own:

* Load the turkanaRain raster dataset
* Create a subset of the last 50 months in the dataset
* Use `global` to get the mean values for this subset and then create a histogram from these values (hint: you may need to use the `$` operator)
* Create a raster that is the sum of the last 10 years (120 months) of rainfall data
* Plot this raster in a blue palette
