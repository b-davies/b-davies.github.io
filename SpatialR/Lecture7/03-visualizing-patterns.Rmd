# Bringing it all together!

OK, now you've seen how we get started with doing some spatial analysis in `spatstat`. Like `sf` and `terra`, this package has its own quirks and conventions that take some getting used to. For this exercise, see if you can do the following:

*Load in the makiloa_boundary2.shp and primary_features.shp files as vector data
*Convert the boundary to an owin object and the features to a point pattern
*Explore the pattern using quadrats, kernel density, and nearest neighbor distance
