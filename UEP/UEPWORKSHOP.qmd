## Data do not speak for themselves

## Why visualize?

Visualization helps to identify patterns and structures in data that are not evident from tables or numerical summaries.

## Making a data visualization

Visualizing data involves *aesthetic mapping*: connecting variables in data to visual elements within a graphing space.

## Making *better* visualizations

Good visualizations can help a reader to better understand data and your interpretation of it.

::: incremental
-   Choose the right chart for the data

-   Maximize the data-to-ink ratio

-   Make deliberate design decisions
:::

## What kind of visualization?

The type of visualization that should be used depends on the kind of information being conveyed.

## What kind of visualization?

![Wilke, Claus. 2019. *Fundamentals of Data Visualization*](Week3Static/chartTypes.png){fig-align="center"}

## Bar charts and histograms

![https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2021/1/28/histograms-and-bar-charts](UEPWORKSHOP_Static/histogram.jpg)

## When [not]{.underline} to use a pie chart

-   When you have a large number of categories

-   When you need to compare more than one chart

![](UEPWORKSHOP_Static/pieCharts.png){fig-align="center"}

## Data-ink

Data-ink (per Tufte 1983[^1]) refers to ink (or pixels) that, if erased, would reduce the information being presented.

[^1]: Tufte, Edward. 1982. *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*. Graphics Press.

Ideally, we want to maximize the ratio of data to ink.

## Data-ink

Visualization with non-data ink.

![](UEPWORKSHOP_Static/dataink0.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Data-ink

Removing some non-data ink.

![](UEPWORKSHOP_Static/dataInk2.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Data-ink

Removing too much non-data ink?

![](UEPWORKSHOP_Static/dataInk4.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Activity: To erase or not to erase?

## Being deliberate about design

How does a design choice help someone understand the data?

::: incremental
-   **Contrast**: Do the visual elements provide adequate contrast to discern between them?

-   **Clarity:** Is the way the data are displayed making it possible to see it's structure?

-   **Highlighting:** Should I use graphical elements to highlight the aspects I think are important?

-   **Labeling:** Is the labeling clear enough?
:::

## Contrast *is* clarity

Be sure foreground (plotting) colors are sufficiently different from background colors to aid readability.

![](UEPWORKSHOP_Static/yellowWhite.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Contrast *is* clarity

When using colors, symbols, or line styles, be sure these are sufficiently different to distinguish between categories.

![](UEPWORKSHOP_Static/salmonTomato.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Using color effectively

![](UEPWORKSHOP_Static/colorPalettes.png){fig-align="center"}

## Accessibility considerations

Some design choices affect some audiences more than others

-   Color palette

-   Text and symbol sizes

![Wilke, Claus. 2019. Fundamentals of Data Visualization](Week3Static/red-green-cvd-sim-1.png)

## Improving readability

Small symbol and label sizes are difficult to read and leave too much white space

![Wilke, Claus. 2019. *Fundamentals of Data Visualization*](UEPWORKSHOP_Static/Aus-athletes-small-1.png)

## Improving readability

Generally speaking, aim for larger text and point sizes.

![Wilke, Claus. 2019. *Fundamentals of Data Visualization*](UEPWORKSHOP_Static/Aus-athletes-good-1.png)

## Getting a clearer view

Large datasets pose challenges for representing their structure in two dimensions.

![atlassian.com/data/charts/what-is-a-scatter-plot](UEPWORKSHOP_Static/scatter1.png)

## Getting a clearer view

Consider ways to illustrate frequency across the dataset

## Avoid being deliberately misleading

Changing the aspect ratio of the graphing space can give the impression that a patterns is more or less dramatic than it s.

![https://eagereyes.org/blog/2013/banking-45-degrees](https://media.eagereyes.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/aspect-ratios.png)

## Avoid being deliberately misleading

Bar charts are used for comparing amounts; zooming in on the region of interest can exaggerate differences.

## Image file formats

There are two main types of image formats

-   Bitmap (also known as raster)

-   Vector

## Bitmap vs Vector

## Bitmap vs Vector

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Bitmap**

-   Sharpness depends on resolution and size

-   Consistent appearance across platforms

-   Best for complex images (photos, large numbers of elements)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Vector**

-   Sharpness is scale-independent

-   Can look differently using different programs

-   Best for simple images (line drawings, simple graphs)

| File Extension | Type   | Use For                |
|----------------|--------|------------------------|
| .jpg           | Bitmap | Photos                 |
| .png           | Bitmap | Line Drawings          |
| .tif           | Bitmap | Print                  |
| .svg           | Vector | Line drawings (online) |
| .pdf           | Vector | General purpose        |

## The big picture

::: incremental
-   Visualization is foremost about making data more understandable

-   Guidelines like maximizing data-ink and being deliberate about design help us make decisions that will facilitate this goal

-   Being conscientious about your audience and your medium will help make your graphic useful to more people
