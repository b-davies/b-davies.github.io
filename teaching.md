### World Archaeology
[Syllabus (July 2015)|http://b-davies.github.io/syllabi/anthro101]

This undergraduate survey course was aimed at providing a foundation in human cultural evolution over the last 2 million years. Students were expected to discuss the following topics including basic methods of analysis (survey, excavation, dating, etc.) used in archaeology: differences between modern theories of cultural evolution and earlier ideas of unilineal cultural evolution, significant developments that led to the emergence of modern humans from archaic ancestors, early human migrations and continental discovery, social and cultural changes associated with the domestication of plants and animals, changes that accompanied the beginnings of social complexity and the significance of the rise of complex society. Examples drawn from locations from around the world were used to illustrate these themes and demonstrate archaeological reasoning. 

### Archaeology and Heritage in the Information Age

This upper division undergraduate course was aimed at exploring the transformative role of digital technology in archaeology and cultural heritage. In lectures, students were encouraged to discuss the fundamentals of different approaches within the context of the broader goals of archaeology and heritage management. Topics included: spatial data, complex systems and simulation, virtual reality, and the preservation of digital objects, among others. Experts in laser scanning, 3D modeling and archaeogaming were invited and provided interactive demonstrations. In labs, students were introduced to a range of techniques including data manipulation and visualization in R, social network analysis, augmented reality using mobile devices, and reconstructing historical landscapes in game engines. By the end of the course students were able to critically assess applications of different methods and approaches to digital archaeology and heritage, obtain and organize open-source data, and utilize data across multiple digital platforms.

### Peoples and Cultures of the Pacific

This undergraduate survey course introduced students to the diversity of cultures and histories of the Pacific Ocean through the lens of anthropology. Framed around Epeli Hau‘ofa’s notion of “our sea of islands”, the course emphasised connections, engagements, and movements between peoples and places, and discusses how Pacific Island cultures adapt, change, and construct identity through history. The course drew on expertise of guest lecturers and demonstrated key concepts in anthropology with examples from fieldwork. Topics discussed include the settlement of the Pacific Islands, the cultural and biological impacts of European colonization, nuclear testing, development and the “MiRAB” economic model, indigeneity in Pasifika popular music, migration and Pacific diasporas in the 20th century, museums as places for Pacific peoples, and indigenous ways of knowing in contemporary research. 

### Understanding Ancient Australia

This co-taught middle and upper division undergraduate course provided an overview of contemporary approaches to Australian archaeology, relationships between Aboriginal hunter gatherers and the archaeological and environmental record, and the changing dynamics between people, land, and history. Specific areas I contributed to included: models of Australian prehistory, Australian lithic technology, the archaeology of the arid zone, Aboriginal Holocene economies, site formation and preservation, late Holocene socioeconomic intensification and Native Title and heritage management in Australia. 

### Landscape Archaeology (graduate seminar)

This graduate-level course provided in-depth coverage of theoretical and methodological approaches to archaeological landscapes. Students were assigned readings each week, and these were discussed at the start of every meeting. Topics included but were not limited to: the archaeology of place, distributional archaeology, temporality and taskscapes, interpretive and phenomenological approaches, the ups and downs of predictive modeling, theorizing digital approaches, time geography and generative modeling. In lab sessions students developed technical skills in geographic information systems (GIS) and agent-based modeling (ABM). For the first half of the course students were instructed in the fundamentals of GIS-based studies, including the acquisition, manipulation, analysis, and visualization of vector and raster datasets. Lab exercises, largely drawn from local archaeological case studies, were used to demonstrate different principles, as well give opportunities to assess strengths and weaknesses of different approaches such as viewshed analysis, cost-path analysis, and spatial statistical methods. During the second half of the course, students learned core ABM design concepts while developing programming and documentation skills.
