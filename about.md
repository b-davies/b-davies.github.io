I'm an anthropologist and archaeologist interested in mobility, population dynamics, and human adaptations to climate change. I draw on computational techniques in my work, and I am interested in how digital technology is used to learn about and interact with the past. I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [University of Utah](https://faculty.utah.edu/u6023090-Benjamin_Andrew_Davies/hm/index.hml). Sometimes I [tweet](http://twitter.com/ba_davies) and [blog](http://simulatingcomplexity.wordpress.com) and [git](http://github.com/b-davies).

I can be reached by email at davies.archaeology AT gmail.com

### Projects

#### [Exploring the history of coupled climatic and human influences on ecosystem changes during the last one million years](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1826666)
A three-year study based in the Western Cape region of South Africa aimed at using geological and archaeological archives to examine the interactions of climate, human activities, and natural ecosystems over very long timespans. 

#### [Long Term Perspectives on Water Security, Food Security, and Land Management Among Pastoralists Experiencing Change](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1924322)
A four-year project based in northern Kenya studying the current intersection of development, land management, and changing environmental circumstances in the context of long-term trends in land use among mobile pastoralists communities. 

#### Using Serious Games to Address Air Quality as an Environmental Health Problem
This project will develop a research-informed serious game to support collective learning in diverse communities regarding issues relating air quality in Utah. Players work to reduce emissions while avoiding stress on local economies and community health. Instead of focusing strictly on technological solutions, this game will emphasize social challenges to achieving clean air goals, especially those tied to community values.

#### [Western New South Wales Archaeology](https://www.researchgate.net/project/WNSWAP-Western-NSW-Archaeology-Program)
A long-term, multidisciplinary study investigating the formation of surface archaeology in arid and semiarid rangelands of southeastern Australia and implications for human population dynamics and mobility during the late Holocene. Project outcomes are being compiled [here](https://wnswap.blogs.auckland.ac.nz).

#### Geography of Interaction in East Polynesia
A project examining how climate, technology, and human decision-making influence the maintenance of interaction networks in East Polynesia. 

#### [Adaptive and Interactive Futures](https://www.niwa.co.nz/natural-hazards/research-projects/serious-games-for-climate-change-adaptation)
A project using ‘serious games’ as a participatory approach to building community capacity for envisioning the natural and societal impacts of global climate change and the adaptive management of coastal environments.

#### Kwokkunum Shell Mound Study
A project exploring the human ecology and heritage management of monumental shellmounds in far north Queensland, Australia.
