I'm an archaeologist who does some digital things. Sometimes I do research at a [university](http://anthro.utah.edu). Sometimes I [teach](https://b-davies.github.io/teaching). Sometimes I also [tweet](http://twitter.com/ba_davies)
and [blog](http://simulatingcomplexity.wordpress.com)
and [git](http://github.com/b-davies).

I can be reached by email at davies.archaeology AT gmail.com
